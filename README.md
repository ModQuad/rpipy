Raspberry Pi Python projects

These are some super simple python projects I worked on to blink and fade RGB LEDs and play with the camera.
They've been written with each color as it's own thing to make the color swirl more randon
The camera one is just to start a preview that I send out through HDMI to another source. Super simple.

I am working on writing just one program to swirl all three colors of an RGB LED.
I am also working on a keystroke to exit out of the camera since it used the enitre frame for the image.

Feel free to send me ideas on how to do the bits in progress. :)
